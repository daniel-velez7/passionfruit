      <h1>Why Passionfruit</h1>
      <p>
        My journey into wellness was initially fuelled by fear and judgement. I
        was constantly afraid of eating the wrong things due to a misguided
        belief that carbohydrates in any form would feed my illness. I was
        frequently experiencing anxiety because I felt that I should have taken
        my health seriously sooner; this created hyper-vigilance and a
        resentment for my ‘old self’ and her ‘bad habits’. So, my ‘new self’
        exercised and meditated compulsively - dedicating all of my time and
        energy into improving myself. Yet, I denied myself the pleasure of
        actually feeling good.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I consumed something that tasted too sweet, I would become triggered.
        It was a vicious cycle that lasted for years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, I reached a breaking point - it was inevitable; and it
        happened while travelling. As I was away from my routines, it was easier
        to cave and to indulge in a bar of candy (Butterfingers). After years
        without anything sweeter than a blueberry gracing my taste buds, the
        ultra sweet processed sugar tasted truly sickening; but I still ate the
        whole damn thing in an act of self flagellation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was during that moment that I realised I was fragmented; that I was
        denying the parts of myself that really needed acknowledgment and
        compassion. Since this incident, I’ve forged a gentler path as I learned
        then that fear around food can cause more damage to the body than the
        food itself. It is the belief about how your body will respond to
        certain foods that can create those responses.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why Passionfruit feels radical to me. Religious paradigms
        demonize pleasure and have associated sweet fruits with testing
        temptation. These belief patterns around virtue and worthiness still
        permeate into the most well intentioned wellness and spiritual
        communities. So, as a recovering ‘virtue junkie’, I now choose to view
        the very existence of fruit as evidence that life is meant to be
        enjoyed. Identifying with Passionfruit is an acceptance of the sweet and
        tangy and an invitation for myself to be with it all.
