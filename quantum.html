      <h1>What is Quantum Krystic Healing (QKH)</h1>
      <p>
        Quantum Krystic Healing is a potent healing modality used for energy
        release and soul alignment. It’s a practice combining principles from
        Traditional Chinese Medicine, the work of Dr. Bradley on trapped
        emotions, the work of Dr. Joe Dispenza about the quantum field, and the
        Krystic teachings of Lisa Renee on multidimensional trauma.
      </p>
      <p>
        These various principles affirm that every emotion is energy in motion;
        and different emotions are just energy vibrating at different
        frequencies. Unprocessed emotions stay in the body in the form of an
        energetic imprint; this is also known as a trapped emotion or trauma.
        These energetic imprints influence the functioning of organs, emotional
        wellbeing, and our experience of the external world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like attracts like meaning our internal vibration will magnetize
        situations and people with a similar energetic frequency. This is how
        our internal environment manifests the external experiences and the
        people we encounter. The more energetic and emotional baggage we carry,
        the more the frequency of the soul, our true essence, is drowned out. It
        then becomes more difficult to attract what is truly in resonance with
        our highest expression. We stay looped in emotional patterns and as a
        result, remain limited by the residual effects of past experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quantum Krystic Healing breaks the karmic cycle by releasing whatever is
        not in resonance with your original divine blueprint.
      </p>
      <p>
        All sessions are under the guidance of your own divine innate healing
        intelligence, communicated through the central nervous system and
        interpreted through kinesiology (muscle testing). Working with virtually
        any intention, we can make quantum leaps towards goals in health,
        career, love, emotional mastery, spiritual connection, and so much more.
      </p>
      <h1>What A QKH Session Entails</h1>
      <p>
        Before receiving a Quantum Krystic Healing session, you will be guided
        towards choosing a specific intention or creating a specific statement.
        This intention or statement will act as a guide towards aligning with
        your highest self.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some examples of intentions: <br />
        To release imbalances contributing to anxiety <br />
        To release imbalances related to a specific health issue <br />
        To release whatever will serve my highest self the absolute most <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        & of statements:
        <br />
        “I always embody my highest holistic health” <br />
        “I effortlessly embody the highest expression of love in all of my
        relationships” <br />
        “I am aligned to my highest lifepath; my divine blueprint”
      </p>
      <p>
        With any guiding intention, we can: <br />

        -Release thousands of trapped emotions from the body (organs, glands,
        etc) and energy field (chakras, auric field, etc) <br />
        -Correct reversals in the flow of energy -Heal and seal fractures in the
        physical and multidimensional bodies, also known as aural tears <br />
        -Uproot subconscious beliefs & aversions to positive beliefs, and then
        installing a counter life affirming belief <br />
        -Dislodge multidimensional trauma from the energy field such as energy
        cords, siphons, entity attachments, psychic attacks, curses, and black
        magic
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the road blocks are removed and ‘internal noise’ is subdued,
        embodying our highest self and life path is natural. The most life
        affirming choices become the most attractive and the most ideal
        opportunities flow into our path.
