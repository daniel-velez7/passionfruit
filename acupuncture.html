      <h1>What Is Acupuncture?</h1>
      <p>
        Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese practice based on the belief that the
        body is comprised of a complex network of energy channels, known as
        “meridians”; vital energy, referred to as “Qi”, flows through these
        meridians like a highway leading to elevated Qi. Disruptions or
        stagnation in the flow of energy along these highways can cause dis-ease
        in the body. Acupuncture is a Traditional Chinese Medicine (T.C.M) that
        is believed to stimulate & enhance the flow of Qi while simultaneously
        restoring overall balance and promoting optimal functioning.
      </p>
      <p>
        To grasp this concept, think of it like this: any injury to the body
        will disrupt its usual mode of functioning. As a result, the immune
        system will respond by sending white blood cells to the damaged area to
        create inflammation and to promote self-healing. This process requires
        energy. By creating minor perforations in the skin at strategic points
        along the highway, this process is intentionally induced as to influence
        the flow of energy in the most life affirming direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Receiving acupuncture can last between 60 to 90 minutes and will feel
        similar to a gentle (internal) massage. Most patients report feeling
        extremely relaxed during and after the session; some can even sense
        shift and flow of internal energy during the session.
      </p>

      <h1>Why You Should Book A Session</h1>
      <p>
        I earned a Master’s Degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine from The
        Shanghai University of T.C.M and since graduating, have five years of
        needling experience. My approach to acupuncture has evolved over the
        years due to my research in quantum mechanics. As a result, I now
        utilize ‘applied kinesiology’ to allow your own nervous system to guide
        me towards the most advantageous acupoints.
      </p>

      <p>
        I know through experience that applying a combination of energy work
        alongside physical work yields the highest results; it also ensures that
        every session is as effective as possible. Combining acupuncture with
        Quantum Krystic Healing will facilitate & support the change needed for
        your body to operate at its highest energetic functioning.
