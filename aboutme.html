      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Passionfruit. I believe that we are all on a mission to
        return to our true essence as to align with our highest self. I’m here
        to assist you on your path towards cultivating internal awareness and
        embodiment of your highest self.
      </p>
      <p>
        How? By guiding you towards identifying the energetic blocks that exist
        within your subconscious, and conscious, mind and letting them go. Our
        experience of ourselves and of the world is coloured by social
        conditioning, limiting beliefs, & emotional baggage that we carry with
        us. These social, mental, & emotional patterns can be released. By
        choosing to work with me & my offerings, your path towards authentic
        self-empowerment will accelerate. Through my own personal experience and
        those of my clients, I can confidently attest to the healing powers of
        acupuncture combined with Quantum Krystic Healing.
      </p>
      <h1>My Journey Into Wellness</h1>
      <p>
        During my childhood, I began to experience chronic fatigue. After some
        trial & error, I discovered acupuncture - an Eastern modality that
        provided support Western medicine could not provide. I was cared for
        emotionally as well as physically and because of the intimate sessions I
        received, I began to deeply admire the work. As a result, I realized
        that I wanted to facilitate healing through this hands-on modality. So,
        I relocated to China in pursuit of a fully immersive educational
        experience. To obtain my Master’s Degree, I provided acupuncture in
        Chinese hospitals and wrote an original research paper that has since
        been published in multiple medical journals. Although acupuncture
        helped, the fatigue persisted and when Covid catapulted through the
        world, my health rippled backwards. During this timeframe, I received a
        Quantum Krystic Healing session. Immediately, I felt an internal shift
        and as a result of this one session, my entire future trajectory
        changed. Instead of seeing the set backs, I now saw a world of
        possibilities at my fingertips.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through Quantum Krystic Healing, I have had the opportunity to cultivate
        an understanding of my internal beliefs and their effect on me. For
        example: how the residual trauma of my chronic illness repeatedly
        sabotaged my attempts at healing. By dismantling the idea that sympathy
        equated love, I simultaneously grasped how I craved disempowerment
        because it felt safe and familiar. In fact, I initially wrote about my
        journey into wellness from a state of mind clouded by victimhood.
        Afterall, if sympathy equated love then I needed to stay pitiable.
        Through Quantum Krystic Healing, I have recognised this pattern and my
        responsibility in creating my experience of myself. Although I still
        experience health dysregulation, the duration only shortens & the
        frequency lessens. It’s worth noting how my change in perception has
        impacted my experience of chronic fatigue: now, I greet these moments
        with compassion & acceptance rather than a sense of personal failure or
        fear. Even emotional dysregulation is seen as an opportunity to notice
        what disempowering beliefs I still hold onto and how I can adjust my
        beliefs accordingly. I hope that by sharing my story, you feel empowered
        to travel deeper into yourself - to discern the blocks creating
        resistance towards living your highest path.
      </p>
      <h1>My Commitment To You</h1>
      <p>
        To support others in the ways I have received support is a pleasure & a
        gift. Health maintenance and emotional mastery is a deep commitment and
        I am ready to assist in your in-cension. By working together, I can
        support you along your journey by making it more clearcut; but more
        importantly, an enjoyable experience of rediscovering yourself. Truly, I
        look forward to co-creating your highest self with you. Remember: your
        true essence already exists, it is already shining through; all you need
        to do is allow it to continue shining by removing the grime that is
        social, mental, & emotional blocks.
